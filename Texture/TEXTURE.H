Texture Test Program - a cheesy test harness for texture mapping

by Chris Hecker for my Game Developer Magazine articles.  See my homepage
for more information.

NOTE: This is a hacked test program, not a nice example of Windows programming.
The texture mappers are the only part of this you should look at.
